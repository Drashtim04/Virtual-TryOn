### Virtual-TryOn

A real-time computer vision application that enables users to virtually try on accessories such as glasses, mustaches, and hats using a webcam. The system leverages facial landmark detection to accurately align and render accessories in live video streams.

## Highlights

* Real-time face tracking using MediaPipe Face Mesh
* Dynamic overlay of multiple accessories with precise landmark anchoring
* Support for live position and scale adjustments during runtime
* Smooth, low-latency rendering using OpenCV

## Tech Stack

* **Python** – Core application logic
* **OpenCV** – Video capture, image processing, and rendering
* **MediaPipe** – 468-point facial landmark detection
* **NumPy** – Geometric transformations and matrix operations

## Use Cases

* Virtual try-on demos
* Computer vision learning projects
* Augmented reality prototyping
